Is divided in two parts:A set of funcions to make the transformation of the input context free grammar into an equivalent Chomsky Normal Form grammar.Another set of functions to implement the CYK algorithm to determine if the input string is accepted by the converted Chomsky Normal Form grammar.A grammar is said to be in Chomsky Normal Form if all of its production rules are of the form: A -&gt; BC or A -&gt; a. The transformation of the input grammar into an equivalent Chomsky Normal Form grammar is based on a central function. It receives the non terminals, terminals and production rules and applies a set of changes in order to accomplish the transformation. The changes consist of removing null productions,removing unit productions, sanitizing productions (remove duplicates and dumb productions), changing right hand side terminals adding a new production for them (when applicable) and changing right hand side non terminal productions with length larger or equal 3. After all these changes, the new grammar is a Chomsky normal form grammar equivalent to the input grammar.Some conventions were applied to make the validation and transformation process easier. The start symbol will always be S. The valid terminals are all the lower case letters of the latin alphabet. The valid non terminals are all the upper case letters of the latin alphabet, except the T and V. The new production rules made for the righ hand side terminals are constructed as Tx -&gt; x. The new production rules made for the right hand side non terminals bigger than or equal 3 are constructed with the Vn non terminal, iex. B -&gt; ABC generates B -&gt; AV1, V1 -&gt; BC.The CYK algorithm is a parsing algorithm for context free grammars, used to determine if a string is accepted by the grammar. The input grammar must be in the Chomsky Normal Form. The algorithm is based in dynamic programming, and it's worst case running time is O(n^3*|G|). Basically the CYK split the word into two parts the prefix and suffix and check the production rules of them and join to see if there is a formation that can generate the joined non terminal final element if there is then add to a list of possible formation rule when splited there.And after that he continues to split the word in ever possible position and do this. After all splits then he join all solution found and check if the start symbol is there. if it is then that word can be generated with this production rules.","ref":"ContextFreeLanguagesRecognition.html","title":"ContextFreeLanguagesRecognition","type":"module"},{"doc":"Central function to perform the Chomsky Normal Form transformation.
